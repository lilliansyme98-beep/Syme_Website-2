    <p> I am a student at Cuny's Graduate School of Journalism. I was born in Michigan and have lived in Chicago, Long Island, and San Francisco before moving to NYC. I am interested in reporting on food, business, and culture.  </p>

    <p> Here are three of my favorite journalism stories: 
<ol>
<li> Top 14 Breakfast Spots in the U.S. <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-new-breakfast-restaurants-cafes-2025" target=>- Bon App√©tit </a> <p>I love this piece because it highlights my favorite meal of the day. </p></li>
<li> A Review of Smithereens by Ligaya Mishan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/dining/dining-smithereens-restaurant-review.html" target =>- NYT </a> <p>Her writing transports me to the restaurant she is writing about in the best way possible. </p></li>
<li> Cartoons on MTA <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/what-a-century-of-new-yorker-cartoons-about-the-subway-tell-us-about-ourselves" target=> - Gothamist</a> <p>I have been a lover of cartoons my whole life and think this piece is really informative.</p> 
</li>
